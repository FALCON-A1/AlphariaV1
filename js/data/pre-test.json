This annual event is normally held on the two day before Ash Wednesday. The excitement begins weeks, even months before the big days. Students and teachers dress in their house colours, sing cheers and practice for each event. Some of the events include cheerleading, cross-country race, one hundred, up eight hundred metre race, shuttle relay and my favourite baton relays. Glucose, oranges and water are a must have for these days as the days are usually very hot and runners get very competitive. Coaches and teachers select their best runners or the person they believe would have a chance at winning. There are four houses at our school. They are Red House, Blue House, Yellow and Green Houses. I had recently transferred from another school and my house leader or captain did not know about my abilities. On the day of the big events, I pleaded with the house leader to let me run but I was told that they had all the athletes for each race already. So I went back to my seat to continue watching the races. When it was time for the eight hundred metres race the announcer called for two runners from each house. Then I overheard the house leader and captain discussing that they only had one name written down. I immediately volunteered myself as both looked at me from head to toe as if to say, he is so frail. The announcer repeated the call and they said go ahead. I quickly changed into my gears and confidently walked onto the field to the starting position. That day, I surpassed everyone's expectations.",

During that period, I am very attentive, especially when a practical is involved. Insects are different and very interesting creatures so I want to learn everything about them. When it is time to explore, I set up an area and then I begin my work. I look for all kinds of insects and put them in different categories. These categories include ants, bugs and worms. Whenever I collect different species I compare them to each other to see what new information I can learn. You would be amazed at the number of different species of worms and bugs inhabiting an area. Furthermore, you would be even more fascinated by the valuable contributions that they make to the environment. I worry about some of these insects becoming extinct. As a result, I want to have a thorough understanding of their needs, challenges and life cycle of each and every insect in my surroundings.",

In 2020 we had the pandemic of the Novel Coronavirus. It crossed many country borders, caused many illnesses and had a devastating effect on their economy. Since people were asked to stay inside to contain the spread, many industries had to close. Tourism, travel and entertainment were the worst hit. Schools also had to be closed and many businesses had to change their model to online operations. Some businesses were ready and others weren't, consequently those did not survive. Governments all over the world had to provide stimulus packages to boost their economy to ensure that they did not collapse or go into a deep recession.
